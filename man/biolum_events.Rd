\title{Identify potential bioluminescence emission events}
\usage{
biolum_events(x, sensitivity = 1.26, max_light = exp(-20))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame such as returned by \code{\link{BioPIC}} output}

\item{sensitivity}{A threshold to decide if a signal peak is high enought. See 
details.}

\item{max_light}{Max light level (W/cm^2) where a event can be detected. Set to 
NULL to disable.}
}

Identify potential bioluminescence emission events

\details{
Sensor sensitivity threshold: The minimum ratio between two measures 
to be considered significantly different. In laboratory experiments, the 
sensors measured light intensity +- 2 units while submitted to a constant 
light intensity. Translating the sensor log-scale units to SI linear scale 
units this accuracy measure translates into a minimum ratio of 1.26
