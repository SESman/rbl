\title{Identify Prey Catch attempts}
\usage{
prey_catch_attempts(x, fs = 16, fc = 2.64, w = 1.5, grp = NULL,
  n_days = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{3 axes acceleration table with time in the first column and acceleration 
axes in the following columns. Variables must be entitled \code{"time"} for time, 
\code{"ax"}, \code{"ay"}, and \code{"az"} for x, y and z accelerometer axes.}

\item{fs}{sampling frequency of the input data (Hz).}

\item{fc}{Cut-off frequency for the butterworth high pass filter (Hz). Frequency 
above which signals across x, y and z accelerometer axes are retained.}

\item{w}{window width in seconds to use when applying rolling standard deviation.}

\item{grp}{A vector (with same number of observation than \code{x}) 
which provides a group identifier for observations to be treated by rolling 
standard deviation separately. For example a dive number 
or a \code{\link{brokenstick}}  segment number. 
Leave as \code{NULL} to process all data as a single block.}

\item{n_days}{time period (in days) over which kmeans clustering of negative 
and positive prey catch attempt behaviours should be performed. 
Leave as \code{NULL} to have no time grouping in kmeans generation.}
}
\value{
returns a logical vector of prey catch attempts at 1 Hz frequency. 
Value is TRUE if the record belong to prey catch attempt FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
Method based on Viviant et al. (2010) (see references) which was originally 
implemented on a jaw accelerometer.
