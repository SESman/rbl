\title{Delimitate bottom phase of dive using vertical speed threshold}
\usage{
bottom_delim_vspd(time = NULL, y = NULL, y.type = c("depth", "vspd"),
  vert_vel = 0.75, w = 21)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{time readings, sorted in chronological order.}

\item{vert_vel}{the verical speed threshold.}

\item{w}{a window width to use for vertical speed smoothing (moving average)
when \code{vspd} is not provided.}

\item{depth}{depth readings, sorted in chronological order.}

\item{vspd}{smoothed verical speed, sorted in chronological order. Optional.
If provided, function is faster as it does not need to compute it from
depth and time.}
}
\description{
Delimitate bottom which is defined as the period between the first and last
moment in the dive were vertical speed (simplified signal using \code{\link{poly}})
exceeds a threshold.
