\title{Delimitate bottom phase of dive using wiggles and steps}
\usage{
bottom_delim_halsey(time, depth = NULL, ledge = 0.5, vert_vel = 0.35)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{time readings, sorted in chronological order.}

\item{depth}{depth readings, sorted in chronological order.}

\item{ledge}{depth threshold, specified as a percentage which is compared
to the maximum depth. 0.75 has been used for king pengins. For
elephant seals: about 95\% of prey catch attemps occur at depth greater
than 50\% of the maximum depth (default value 0.50).}

\item{vert_vel}{A threshold used to define the steps. 0.35 m/s has been used for
king pengins.}
}
\description{
Improves \code{\link{bottom_delim_std}} by defining a lower ledge (which implies
longer bottoms) but reducing the bottom phase to a more relevant period
(where specific behavior seems to indicate intensive foraging search). This
is achieved by selecting the period between the first and last step/wiggle
(see function \code{\link{wiggles}}) deeper than the ledge.
