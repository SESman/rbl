\title{Static acceleration}
\usage{
static_acc(x, fs = 16, fc = 0.2, Gscale = TRUE, agg_1hz = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{3 axes acceleration table with time in the first column and acceleration 
axes in the following columns. Variables must be entitled \code{"time"} for time, 
\code{"ax"}, \code{"ay"}, and \code{"az"} for x, y and z accelerometer axes.}

\item{fs}{sampling frequency of the input data (Hz).}

\item{fc}{Cut-off frequency for the butterworth low pass filter (Hz)}

\item{Gscale}{Should the values be scaled by the norm of the static 
acceleration vector ?}

\item{agg_1hz}{Should the input be aggregated to 1 Hz ?}
}
\value{
returns a data.frame with time, and X, Y and Z static accelearyion at 1 Hz.
}
\description{
The raw acceleration is first filtered using a low pass butterworth filter. 
Then , the extracted signal can be scaled so that the norm of the the vector 
G is 1 at each second.
}
\details{
This filtered acceleration can be used to compute pitch and roll angles
