\title{Compute swimming effort}
\usage{
swimming_effort(x, fs = 16, fc = c(0.4416, 1.0176), rms = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{3 axes acceleration table with time in the first column and acceleration 
axes in the following columns. Variables must be entitled "time" for time, 
"ax", "ay", and "az" for x, y and z accelerometer axes.}

\item{fs}{sampling frequency of the input data (Hz).}

\item{fc}{Cut-off frequencies for the butterworth band pass filter (Hz)}

\item{rms}{Should the root mean square be used (instead of mean of absolute values) 
when averaging the acceleration to 1 Hz ?}
}
\value{
returns a vector of swimming effort values at 1 Hz.
}
\description{
Compute swimming effort
}
\details{
Only Y accelerometer axe is used to compute swimming effort.
