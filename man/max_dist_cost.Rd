A statistic to minimize.

\description{
Given a model and data the function returns a single value which is used to
determine if the number of points is optimized: the cost function value being
minimized by the optimal set of parameters.
}
\details{
\code{max_dist_cost} In this function the statistic is the maximun distance between an
observation and its fitted value. Hence the function constantly decrease with
increasing number of point in the model and a threshold must be provided along
with this function to avoid infinite looping. Yet, the pros of this cost function
is a threshold that is simple to determine and to interpret.

\code{dist_per_pt_cost} In this function the statistic is the
average distance between observations and fitted values divided by the number of
points used by the model. This function has does rech a minimun value but
generally for high numbers of points.

\code{rss_cost} In this function the statistic is the sum of
squared residuals.

\code{dzi_cost} In this function the statistic is the Dive Zone Index.
