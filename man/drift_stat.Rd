\title{Use brokensticks to identify potential drifts}
\usage{
drift_stat(object, thres.bsm = 5, bsm = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{SES} object including a TDR dataset, a "dives statistics" 
table and a "delim" table.}

\item{thres.bsm}{a threshold to use with \code{\link{max_dist_cost}} when 
running \code{\link{optBrokenstick}}.}

\item{bsm}{A list of brokenstick models to use directly instead of computing a 
new one with \code{thres.bsm} as parameter.}
}
\value{
A data frame of all brokenstick segments with start and end index of 
the segment, no_seg_tot and ID number of the segement, no_seg_dive the number 
of the segment within its dive, no_dive the ID of the dive conataining the segment, 
time the starting time of segment, drift_rate the vertical speed of the segment, 
dur the duration of the segment, min_depth and max_depth the minimum and maximum 
depths of the segment, acceleration statistics (if acceleration data available) 
average roll, pitch and swimming effort and PCA rate, the mean squared residuals 
of the segment.
}
\description{
\code{drift_stat} takes an object and return a data frame of all the brokenstick 
segments along the trip with statistics such as their vertical speed (average 
and standard deviation), their duration and so on. This data frame is to be 
filtered to identify drift segments.
}
\details{
To get average pitch and roll angles (degrees), the TDR table must include 
static acceleration with variable names "axG", "ayG" and "azG". Similarly, for 
swimming effort and PCA rate, the TDR table must have columns "swm_eff" (numeric) 
and "is_pca" (logical). Use functions \code{\link{static_acc}}, 
\code{\link{swimming_effort}} and \code{\link{prey_catch_attempts}} to compute 
these variables from the raw acceleration readings.
